##Introduction:

Welcome to Programming Assignment 01 - The Art Gallery! 

---
##Background:
In this program, we are working for a consulting firm that has been hired by a chain of art galleries to increase revenues. Specifically, we are tasked to design a more effective way of hanging art pieces on the gallery walls. Each wall of the gallery has a set dimension, and each picture a designated value and dimension. We must ultimately determine which pieces should be displayed on the wall in order to maximize revenue.

##Implementation:
In this program, there are three algorithms for determining which painting will be on the wall. 
1. The Brute Force Approach - This algorithm will be used for paintings under our 10 painting limit. The objective of this algorithm is to find the maximum value of a subset of pictures on the wall through a 'brute-force' approach.
2. The Most Expenisve First - In this algorithm, we sort the pictures in decreasing order by value, add them to the wall in order, and skip any that will not fit.
3. The Custom - TODO
